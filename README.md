This project is a Telegram bot developed using the [Telebot](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) library. The bot can automatically checks user messages for links and bans those who send them. The bot also has the function of automatically accepting people into a group.

This is all done for testing and is not intended as a serious project.
